            <header>This Portfolio</header>
            This websites dynamic background was created using the Threejs library. The center planet, 
            its wireframe halo and the tetrahedron 'asteroids' are all rendered seperately and animated 
            with random offsets and rotations that are different each time the site is loaded. 
            The layout is a single column design of flexboxes that contain reactive content cards.

                <header>Edge Detection</header>
                I wanted to learn and practice image processing and edge detection and chose C++. I used the stb_image C library
                for basic input and output, and wrote everything else from scratch. The algoritm implemented is the 
                convolution based Sobel Ooperator that finds vertical and horizontal edges and merge them.

                <header>Physics Simulations</header>
                This repository contains 4 simulations currently, all done in python. A fluid dynamics simulation to demonstrate Chaos Theory,
                two seperate heat transfer simulations, one in a single dimension, and another in two dimensions, and an orbit simulation of 
                our solar system. These simulations are mathematically accurate, and are done using Numpy and either Matplotlib or pygame for  
                visualization.

                <header>Relational Database</header>
                This project was done for the databases course at CSUF. I designed and developed a relational 
                database using mySQL to store student and professor personal data, classes, and grades. Additionally,
                I built a simple PHP front-end to facilitate queries and display their results. This projects front-end
                and databse were hosted on CUSF's linux server environment for the duration of the class.

                <header>React Recipe App</header>
                This website is a recipe and cooking web app that uses the Spoonacular API to search for
                and display recipes. It was designed to have a responsive front-end with the React.js library.
                The same recipe card structure is used when searching for recipes, and viewing saved recipes.
                Saved recipes are stored locally as cookies to persist between sessions.
